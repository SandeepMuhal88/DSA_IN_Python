# Q1. what is queue ?

# queue = fifo


# operation

# 1. enqueue = add element(last)
# 2. dequeue = first element will deleted
# 3. is_empty =
# 4. peek = top (first element)
# 5. size


# concept 1

# l1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# l2 = []
# for i in range(1, len(l1)):
#     l2.append(l1[i])
# l1 = l2

# print(l1)

# time complexity = 0(n)
# space complexity = o(n)


# Q. you have to make function. you have to give an index and element will be deleted

# def functionName(l,index):
#     pass
# l1 = [10,20,30,40,50]
# l1 = [10,20,30,50]


# concept 2
# name = "jai"
# name = "jp"
